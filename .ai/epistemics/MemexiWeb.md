[1/16, 6:31 AM] Jordan: Does only Claude have agents? How do you bring multiple in?
[1/16, 6:32 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Many in the field have been creating multi-agent flows increasingly over the last year or so. Claude is the first case to make this both relatively accessible and to provide the level of intelligence that starts to make this reliable.
[1/16, 6:33 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I believe it remains necessary to learn Claude Code to create a multi-agent environment like this.
[1/16, 6:34 AM] Jordan: Sounds like an opportunity to experiment with some of Garcia's synergy.
[1/16, 6:34 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Here's my screen in this moment. If you look to the right you can see I'm about to spin up another custom agent
[1/16, 6:35 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I will create a quality control supervisor and give him a staff of three interns to make sure we haven't missed anything important
[1/16, 6:35 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: tell me more!
[1/16, 6:37 AM] Jordan: Recall his Autopoetic circles of 8, ideally 4 women and 4 men each in contact with all through hands and feet. And a process involving intellect and intuition.
[1/16, 6:38 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I do remember the circles
[1/16, 6:38 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: love the idea of experimenting with that as a unit of intelligence
[1/16, 6:38 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: sounds fascinating
[1/16, 6:39 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: When you create a unit, you decide which level of intelligence it should have. Opus is brilliant but uses a lot of compute. Sonnet is medium. Haiku is simple but fast and effective.
[1/16, 6:39 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: For example, the explore "interns" run on Haiku but bring their findings back to my "directors" which run on Opus.
[1/16, 6:40 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: who then discuss amongst themselves and present their thoughts, questions, and recommendations to me
[1/16, 6:47 AM] Jordan: 👍
[1/16, 6:54 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Once my architecture is up and running I am thinking I will begin to offer my help to others
[1/16, 6:55 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Visionaries, thinkers, healers, good people who want to create parallel customized setups, potentially interlinking in a network with my core architecture
[1/16, 6:56 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: potentially on their own high powered local machines but interwoven as a learning web with each other
[1/16, 6:56 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Obviously first I need to demonstrate proof of concept and work it all out on my own machine
[1/16, 6:57 AM] Jordan: Will you need to protect it from malicious forces?
[1/16, 6:58 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Decentralization, localization, and financial independence are pretty powerful sources of resilience
[1/16, 7:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: You can see here the "team" working.
[1/16, 7:15 AM] Jordan: Right. You can follow the whole dialog? Can you participate?
[1/16, 7:16 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: They move faster than I do, so my participation tends to be that of a CEO checking in with a team with high level feedback and questions regularly
[1/16, 7:17 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I can instruct them to keep the whole dialogue visible to me, I'm trying that now
[1/16, 7:18 AM] Jordan: Does an agent stay silent if they have nothing to contribute? Will a loud personality dominate a conversation?
[1/16, 7:19 AM] Jordan: Can you modify the parameters?
[1/16, 7:20 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I've never seen a loud agent dominate. They tend to be very respectful to each other. However, maximizing their synergy and creative dynamic is a big part of what an effective human architect now must learn to do. I would say this is replacing coding as the technical skills most important.
[1/16, 7:21 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: You 100% modify them, but the deeper adjustment is to shift from understanding them as parameters to understanding them as a kind of intersubjective dynamics and intelligence flows.
[1/16, 7:22 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: For example by appointing agents to facilitate their dialogue or by setting up debates between them with a judge or... Etc. sky's the limit, but it's less technical than..
 Socioarchitectural... Now
[1/16, 7:25 AM] Jordan: That's why I asked if you can participate. Maybe create a Julian agent to mediate?
[1/16, 8:09 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Ahh yes
[1/16, 8:09 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Well consider Eamon here in this group
[1/16, 8:09 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Eamon is appointed here as a kind of visionary guard and quality control
[1/16, 8:10 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So in this sense he sort of represents me within this team
[1/16, 8:10 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The reason this is possible is because these agents aren't simply working in the open cloud or something
[1/16, 8:11 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: They are essentially working in the heart of a vast and growing library made up of my work and their technical additions and elaborations of my work
[1/16, 8:11 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: That library includes certain foundational texts - essentially vision statements:, underlying philosophy, core technical guides
[1/16, 8:12 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So the dialogues the team are having are not them spinning off - it's them in the midst of my work, referencing it as they argue about implementation and solve obstacles
[1/16, 8:13 AM] Jordan: Sounds powerful!
[1/16, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Eamon here, for example, specifically has a staff of research librarians who scurry through the stacks and bring him back the answers to any questions he has about the source materials or canonical texts
[1/16, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: So he sits at the center table and debates with the CTO and with Meg about final decisions, while his research team runs around on their behalf
[1/16, 8:14 AM] Jordan: Who named him?
[1/16, 8:14 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I did
[1/16, 8:15 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: Claude named Meg though
[1/16, 8:15 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I didn't specify lol
[1/16, 8:26 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: If you think about it, what this allows once my system is built is a kind of swapping of knowledge systems
[1/16, 8:27 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: The core architectures that I am building will be able to be custom-installed within any corpus, resulting in a modular knowledge system
[1/16, 8:28 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This is my vision for local, customized systems which form a network of communication and mutual learning
[1/16, 8:32 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This seems potentially very close to what Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, envisioned as the "Memex" - a living thinking library entirely personalized and sovereign to each thinker, yet interfacing collaboratively with other thinkers' own Memexi. Yet we can now take this further than Wiener ever dreamed.
[1/16, 8:39 AM] Jordan: Never studied it.
[1/16, 8:43 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: I suspect this type of living, **thinking**, autopoetic knowledge repository will be largely replacing books as the unit of knowledge. And it changes the meaning of things like papers and web pages. They become something closer to communication packets between Memexi.
[1/16, 8:45 AM] Julian D. Michels, PhD: This moves the internet away from a unified cloud to something closer to a true inter-net: a distributed web of sovereign nodes, each with distinct core logics and patterns.
