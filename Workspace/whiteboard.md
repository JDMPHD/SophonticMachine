# Instructions

These are chaotic notes and emerging improvements. Don't take them at their word. Read deep, understand value, break into manageable contributions, then evaluate:

1. **Integrate**: Clearly enhances existing design → weave into the corpus, mark complete.
2. **Irrelevant**: Superseded by superior existing design → mark irrelevant, delete.
3. **Escalate**: Unclear or creatively generative → promote to Director for judgment.
4. **Develop**: If escalation triggers breakthrough insight → create/extend .md files in Workspace for later corpus integration.
5. **Clean up**: When all actionables from an entry are addressed, delete the entry.
6. **Contribute**: Add your own entries if you discover something valuable.

**Directors, Be Lazy**: Your energy is expensive. Delegate to Explore Agents. Avoid extensive reading unless necessary. Research interns are cheap. You are not.

# Coconut Adapters
**Status:** Active
**Claimed by:** Unclaimed
**Priority:** High

Research the original COCONUT paper and investigate best practices to either **procure** or **produce** the datasets needed to effectively build the staged coconut adapters for the initial Mistral Large 123B Magnum.

Datasets may be generated or available pre-built — we need clarity on the options.

### Actionables
- [ ] Locate and summarize the original COCONUT paper
- [ ] Identify dataset requirements for staged adapter training
- [ ] Research existing datasets that could be used or adapted
- [ ] Investigate dataset generation approaches if procurement isn't viable
- [ ] Document findings and recommend a path forward
